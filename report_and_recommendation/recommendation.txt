1003 1049 ï¼š can be changed, no recommendation

1065:
CTA1065:count number: CTA recommended to ignore this warning. but you can also consider replacing "item_ct1.barrier();" with
"item_ct1.barrier(sycl::access::fence_space::local_space); to have have better performance if the kernel function has no memory accesses in the global memory,"

1039(27/32 same):
CTA1039:count number: Base on the experience, strongly recommended to leave the code as it is and ignore this warning.
BUT, if the first parameter of an atomic function points to a local memory address space,
replace the atomic function name with an atomic function name that includes the template parameters.

1008(15/15 same):
CTA1008:count number:  The clock function is not defined in DPC++, you can leave the code as it is for now.
and consult with your hardware vendor to find a replacement.

1000(9/9same) 1001(9/9same):
CTA1000/1001:count number: Base on the experience, strongly recommended to ignore this warning.

1032(5/8 same):
CTA1032:count number: Base on the experience, recommended to ignore this warning. If it didn't work, please adjust the code.

1009(data hungry):
CTA1009:count number: SYCL uses exceptions to report errors and does not use the error codes.
The original code was commented out and a warning string was inserted. You need to rewrite this code

1010(data hungry):[can look at it later: SYCL uses exceptions to report errors and does not use the error codes.
The call was replaced with 0. You need to rewrite this code.]
CTA1010:count number: Base on the experience, strongly recommended to ignore this warning.

1011(data hungry):[can look at it later]
CTA1011:count number: recommendation: delete the namespace

1007(data hungry):
CTA1007:count number: Migration of this CUDA API is not supported by the Intel(R)DPC Compatibility Tool. Please rewrite it by yourself.

1017(data hungry):
CTA1017:count number: The sycl: sincos call is used instead of the sincosf call. These two calls do not provide exactly the same functionality.
Check thepotential precision and/or performance issues for the generated code. Two 1017 warnings in CTA analysis data pool choose not to change anything.



1013,1011,1004: no manual files -------- not give any recommendation for now

CTA1013:count number:The rounding mode could not be specified and the generated code may have different precision then the original code.
Verify the correctness.SYCL math built-ins rounding mode is aligned with OpenCL C 1.2 standard.

CTA1011:count number:The tool detected overloaded operators for built-in vector types, which may conflict with the SYCL 1.2.1 standard operators
(see 4.10.2.1 Vec interface). The tool inserted a namespace to avoid the conflict. Use SYCL 1.2.1 standard operators instead.

CTA1004:count number: Could not generate replacement. Please replace it manually.
